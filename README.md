# FlappyPokemon
A silly little Flappy Bird clone where the bird is replaced with an even sillier Magikarp.

It keeps track of the highest score of the player. The Magikarp jumps when you press down on the space bar. And once the game over screen is encountered, you may press Enter to begin a new game again.
